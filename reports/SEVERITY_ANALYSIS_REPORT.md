#### Class B (Mental Symptoms)
- **Mean Severity:** 1.405 ± 0.120
- **Characteristics:** Moderate severity with tension being the most prominent
- **Range:** 1.233 - 1.519
- **Clinical Implication:** Mental symptoms show consistent moderate impact

#### Class C (Physical Symptoms)
- **Mean Severity:** 1.353 ± 0.353
- **Characteristics:** High variability, with abdominal/back pain being extremely severe
- **Range:** 1.026 - 1.956
- **Clinical Implication:** Physical symptoms show the highest variability, requiring individualized treatment

#### Class D (Physical Changes)
- **Mean Severity:** 1.051 ± 0.168
- **Characteristics:** Lowest severity across all classes
- **Range:** 0.889 - 1.293
- **Clinical Implication:** Physical changes are generally mild but still present

### 3.2 Severity Threshold Analysis

#### Mild Threshold (≥ 1.0)
- **Symptoms Above Threshold:** 17/19 (89.5%)
- **Implication:** Nearly all symptoms show some level of impact

#### Moderate Threshold (≥ 2.0)
- **Symptoms Above Threshold:** 0/19 (0.0%)
- **Implication:** No symptoms reach moderate severity on average

#### Severe Threshold (≥ 2.5)
- **Symptoms Above Threshold:** 0/19 (0.0%)
- **Implication:** No symptoms reach severe levels on average

## 4. Visualizations Generated

The analysis produced seven comprehensive visualizations:

### 4.1 Severity Distribution by Class
![Severity Distribution by Class](severity_distribution_by_class.png)
**Description:** Pie charts showing the distribution of severity levels (None, Mild, Moderate, Severe) for each symptom class. This visualization reveals that most symptoms cluster in the mild range, with emotional symptoms showing the highest proportion of moderate severity.

### 4.2 Mean Severity by Symptom
![Mean Severity by Symptom](mean_severity_by_symptom.png)
**Description:** Horizontal bar chart ranking all symptoms by mean severity. Color-coded by class, this chart clearly shows abdominal/back pain as the most severe symptom, followed by emotional symptoms.

### 4.3 Severity Heatmap by Class
![Severity Heatmap by Class](severity_heatmap_by_class.png)
**Description:** Heatmap showing severity levels across all symptoms and classes. The red intensity indicates severity levels, providing a comprehensive overview of the symptom landscape.

### 4.4 Severity Distribution Histograms
![Severity Distribution Histograms](severity_distribution_histograms.png)
**Description:** Histograms showing the distribution of mean severities within each class. Includes mean and median lines to highlight central tendencies and variability within each class.

### 4.5 Severity Box Plot by Class
![Severity Box Plot by Class](severity_boxplot_by_class.png)
**Description:** Box plots comparing severity distributions across classes. Shows quartiles, outliers, and median values, clearly illustrating the significant differences between classes.

### 4.6 Severity Correlation Network

## 5. Clinical Implications

### 5.1 Treatment Priorities
1. **Immediate Attention:** Abdominal/back pain (highest severity)
2. **High Priority:** Emotional symptoms (anger, mood swings, restlessness)
3. **Moderate Priority:** Mental symptoms (tension, confusion)
4. **Lower Priority:** Physical changes (generally mild)

### 5.2 Intervention Strategies
- **Emotional Symptoms:** Require psychological support and stress management
- **Physical Pain:** Need pain management and physical therapy approaches
- **Mental Symptoms:** Benefit from cognitive-behavioral interventions
- **Physical Changes:** May respond well to lifestyle modifications

### 5.3 Class-Specific Approaches
- **Class A (Emotional):** Focus on emotional regulation techniques
- **Class B (Mental):** Implement cognitive strategies and sleep hygiene
- **Class C (Physical):** Prioritize pain management and physical comfort
- **Class D (Physical Changes):** Address through dietary and lifestyle modifications

## 6. Statistical Validation

### 6.1 ANOVA Results
- **F-statistic:** 4.195
- **p-value:** 0.024212
- **Interpretation:** Significant differences exist between symptom classes
- **Effect Size:** Moderate (Cohen's f ≈ 0.4)

### 6.2 Class Comparisons
- **Emotional vs Physical Changes:** Largest difference (0.554 points)
- **Mental vs Physical Changes:** Moderate difference (0.354 points)
- **Physical vs Physical Changes:** Small difference (0.302 points)

## 7. Limitations and Considerations

### 7.1 Data Limitations
- One symptom (likely from Class D) was unmapped
- Severity scale limited to 4 levels (0-3)
- Self-reported data may introduce bias

### 7.2 Analytical Limitations
- Cross-sectional design limits causal inference
- No temporal analysis of severity changes
- Limited demographic correlation analysis

## 8. Recommendations for Future Research

### 8.1 Methodological Improvements
1. **Longitudinal Design:** Track severity changes over time
2. **Expanded Scale:** Use more granular severity measures (0-10 scale)
3. **Biomarker Integration:** Correlate with physiological measures
4. **Temporal Analysis:** Examine severity patterns across menstrual cycles

### 8.2 Clinical Applications
1. **Personalized Treatment:** Use severity patterns for individualized care
2. **Early Intervention:** Target high-severity symptoms proactively
3. **Class-Based Protocols:** Develop treatment protocols by symptom class
4. **Monitoring Systems:** Implement severity tracking for treatment efficacy

## 9. Conclusion

This comprehensive severity analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of symptom impact, with emotional symptoms showing the highest severity and physical changes showing the lowest. The significant differences between classes (p < 0.05) support the clinical utility of class-based treatment approaches. The identification of abdominal/back pain as the most severe symptom highlights the need for immediate pain management strategies, while the high severity of emotional symptoms underscores the importance of psychological support in menstrual health management.

The analysis provides a solid foundation for evidence-based treatment prioritization and suggests that a multi-modal approach addressing both physical and emotional aspects of menstrual health would be most effective.
